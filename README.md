# Population Simulation Project

## Overview

This project simulates the behavior of individuals in a city, encompassing job opportunities, education, and housing dynamics. It features agents with varied job roles, a schooling system for education, and a visualization component to track simulation outcomes.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following components:

- **city/**
  - `__init__.py` : Initialization file for the city module.
  - `city.py` : Contains the `City`, `Property`, and `Company` classes.

- **agents/**
  - `__init__.py` : Initialization file for the agents module.
  - `agent.py` : Contains the `Agent` class, representing individuals in the simulation.

- **laws/**
  - `__init__.py` : Initialization file for the laws module.
  - `tax_law.py` : Defines functions related to tax laws and their effects on agents.

- **config/**
  - `config.py` : Contains configuration settings for the simulation.

- **visualization.py** : Streamlit application for visualizing simulation data.

- **main.py** : The entry point for running the simulation.

- **requirements.txt** : Lists the required Python packages.

- **.gitignore** : Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

- **README.md** : This file.
