# Population Simulation Project

## Overview

This project simulates the behavior of individuals in a city, encompassing job opportunities, education, and housing dynamics. It features agents with varied job roles, a schooling system for education, and a visualization component to track simulation outcomes.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following components:

- **city/**
  - `__init__.py` : Initialization file for the city module.
  - `city.py` : Contains the `City`, `Property`, and `Company` classes.

- **agents/**
  - `__init__.py` : Initialization file for the agents module.
  - `agent.py` : Contains the `Agent` class, representing individuals in the simulation.

- **laws/**
  - `__init__.py` : Initialization file for the laws module.
  - `tax_law.py` : Defines functions related to tax laws and their effects on agents.

- **config/**
  - `config.py` : Contains configuration settings for the simulation.

- **visualization.py** : Streamlit application for visualizing simulation data.

- **main.py** : The entry point for running the simulation.

- **requirements.txt** : Lists the required Python packages.

- **.gitignore** : Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

- **README.md** : This file.

## Installation

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd PeopleSim
   ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   - Create a virtual environment (recommended):

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```

   - Activate the virtual environment:

     - On Windows:

       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```

     - On macOS/Linux:

       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

4. **Install Required Packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Simulation**

   To start the simulation, execute:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This command will run the simulation and save the results to `simulation_results.csv`.

2. **Visualize Data with Streamlit**

   - Install Streamlit (if not already installed):

     ```bash
     pip install streamlit
     ```

   - Run the Streamlit app:

     ```bash
     streamlit run visualization.py
     ```

   - Open the provided URL in your web browser to view trends and specific agent data.

## File Descriptions

- **city/city.py**: Manages city properties and companies through the `City`, `Property`, and `Company` classes.
- **agents/agent.py**: Defines the `Agent` class, including job roles, income, education, and housing status.
- **laws/tax_law.py**: Contains functions for applying and managing tax laws affecting agents.
- **config/config.py**: Provides configuration settings such as city dimensions and simulation parameters.
- **main.py**: Entry point for running the simulation.
- **visualization.py**: Streamlit application to visualize simulation data, including income and savings trends.
